# transit-time
## A simple form/table app for tracking transit

This app is focused around Los Angeles transit and features a directory for a subset of LA's bus trainsit system, the Big Blue Bus.

Transit lines can be clicked to add them to the tracker, or enter your own custom info.

Transit times are not updated in real-time, nor are they entirely accurate, and should be verified to account for delays or other changes.

Ideally, I would be able to add accurate timetables and account for AM/PM instead of using 24-hour time formatting. I had a very hard time with moment.js already though.
